        <div class="description">
            <p>LSE doesn't walk through the world - they carve their path through it with glacial inevitability. They are human geometry, all perfect angles and unforgiving edges. Where others have personalities, they have operating principles.</p>

            <p>In conversation, they speak in binary:<br />
                "That is correct."<br />
                "That is incorrect."<br />
                No qualifiers. No apologies. Their words land like stone tablets fresh from the mountain.</p>

            <p>Their professional presence:</p>

            <p>They're the employee who rewrites the entire company policy manual over lunch - not to improve it, but because the existing one "violated logical consistency." When asked to compromise, they simply repeat their position slower, as if explaining arithmetic to a sleep-deprived child.</p>

            <p>Social interactions follow predictable patterns:<br />
                Someone expresses an opinion<br />
                LSE states why it's wrong<br />
                The universe adjusts itself accordingly</p>

            <p>In relationships, they don't date - they execute binding contracts with emotional clauses. Their partners receive love letters that read like legal briefs, complete with cited precedents for their affection.</p>

            <p>Their superpower: Being the only person in any room who actually understands their own principles.</p>

            <p>Their tragic flaw: Mistaking rigidity for purity, and humanity for a correctable error margin.</p>

            <p>Final Thought:</p>

            <p>LSE is the reason philosophers invented the word "unyielding." They don't adapt to reality - reality eventually concedes to their version of events through sheer exhaustion.</p>
